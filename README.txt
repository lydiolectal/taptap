Description:

The objective of the game is to tap out a beat to music, which is symbolized by colored dots representing each beat. The dots float towards the user at a regular speed, and the user is supposed to tap when the dot reaches the edge of the screen, in time with the music. There are four rows of dots going from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen. The difficulty of the song is indicated after the song title in parentheses. --HOW IT WORKS--

Rule:

Each time when a player presses a key within 400 milliseconds before or after the actual dot, 10 points will be add to the total score.

Run the program:

Click "Main.java" to run the program.

Issues/Improvement:

Javafx does not allow us to use a relative path to access text files. Therefore when we open a text file we use: "/folder_name/.txt". If you still encounter any compiler errors when running the program, change the file path to an absolute path. We have test the program on different computers, only one or two computers had this error.
